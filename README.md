Update: Unfortauntely, I had to take down Meetmap because Meetup no longer offer access to its API unless you have a Pro account. RIP Meetmap <3

Meetmap


This app will allow you to view Meetup events on a map.

When the page loads, user will be asked permission to gain access to their
current location. Click yes and the map will zoom in to current location. If
the user does not want to allow this, there is functionality to type in a city.

The user can then choose from a variety of parameters such as topic and date.

The map will populate with markers indicating the events matching the user's
criteria.

The user can click a marker to see the event name and a link to the
event on Meetup.com.
