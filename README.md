This app will allow you to view Meetup events on a map.

When the page loads, user will be asked permission to gain access to their
current location. Click yes and the map will zoom in to current location.

The user can then choose from a variety of specifications such as topic and date
and then click Submit. The map will populate with markers indicating the
events matching the user's criteria. The user can click a marker to see a pop-up
with the event name and a link to the event on Meetup.com.
